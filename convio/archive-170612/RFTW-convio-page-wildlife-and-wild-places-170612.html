<h3>Wildlife and Wild Places</h3>
<p class="FreeForm">On Earth Day 2015,
Madagascar announced the creation of 27 marine protected areas, including three
community reserves. Our work with coastal communities had demonstrated to the
government that locally managed marine areas work and are good for both nature
and people. This innovative, rights-based model is now a national conservation
policy of Madagascar.</p>
<p class="FreeForm">Other
wildlife-rich places aren&rsquo;t as lucky. Both on land and at sea, animals face
innumerable threats, from poaching to habitat loss, climate change to disease.</p>
