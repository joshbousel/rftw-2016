<h3 class="rftw-subheader">Bag Search</h3>
<p>Your safety while participating in the WCS Run for the Wild is our greatest concern. We are asking for your cooperation with security procedures and advising that <strong>all participants and spectators will be subject to bag searches at all points of entry to the Bronx Zoo.</strong> In order to expedite the process, we strongly advise that you limit what you bring into the park and if possible, leave items in your vehicle. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.  </p>
<hr />
<h3 class="rftw-subheader">Getting Here</h3>
<p>As always, we strongly encourage you to be green and car pool or use public transportation. Together, we can make a difference! Zoo parking is limited due to construction.  Consider car service options.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.mta.info/maps/submap.html">Subway</a><br />#2 train to the Pelham Parkway/White Plains Road stop. Walk west to the Bronx River entrance (closest location to registration). The West Farms Square/East Tremont will NOT be an accessible option to the Asia gate entrance. The Asia Entrance will be closed. We strongly recommend the Pelham Parkway/White Plains stop for its proximity to the start line and event activities.

<p><strong>NEW THIS YEAR  WAVE STARTS</strong><br />
All participants please keep in mind that this race will feature staggered starts to improve the flow of runners on the course. Look for the pace group signs (7 MIN, 8 MIN, 9 MIN, 10 MIN +) held up by staff in lime green shirts along the start line. Faster runners to the front! Once within your predicted pace group wait until your wave is directed to start the run. The waves will be released at regular intervals, with the first wave (7 MIN pace group) leaving at the first starting horn, followed by an additional starting horn for each subsequent start. 
Because this event is not a competitive or official timed race, runners&#8217; race net times will NOT be recorded from when they cross the start and finish line. Please clock yourself and take note of the time you cross both the start and finish line for an accurate 5K time.</p>
<p><strong>As we make improvements to our park by the starting area, we ask that you adhere to all the course marshal&#8217;s instructions and posted signs and remain only on the running lane.  Your safety is of our greatest concern.</strong></p>
