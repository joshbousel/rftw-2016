Hi –

Our generation is lucky to live in a world with XX, elephants, lions, gorillas, and countless other species. They need our help for a bright future, which is why I’ve decided to participate in the WCS Run for the Wild at the Bronx Zoo on April 29.

I care about saving XX, and I hope you do, too. The money I raise will help fund WCS’s critical work to save XX and other wildlife around the globe.

Today, animals are going extinct 10,000 times faster than ever before. African elephant populations have plummeted due to poaching to feed the ivory trade, and recent news from the field has often been bleak. Lion populations in Uganda have declined by 30% in ten years. War, hunting, and habitat loss have had a severe impact on gorilla populations. 

This news is devastating to but WCS is working to give wildlife a fighting chance. The organization recently launched a plan to conserve the world’s largest wild places in 15 priority regions. Together, those are home to more than 50% of the world’s biodiversity!

I want to help, which is why I’m running in the WCS Run for the Wild at the Bronx Zoo on April 29th. The 5k run supports WCS in establishing and helping to manage parks and reserves, safeguarding animals from poaching with active monitoring and patrolling, and inspiring communities to protect their local wildlife.

WCS has the reach and the expertise to make a difference, but the organization needs our help to make that that protection a reality. That’s where you and I come in.

With your support, I hope to raise my target of $XXX. Even $10 would make a big difference for XX.

P.S. Not only does my run support a great cause – it's also a really fun day at the zoo! If you have an animal near and dear to your heart, join me on April 29. You can register here: http://e.wcs.org/site/TR?fr_id=1190&pg=entry

Thank you for your support. I can't wait to tell you about my run through the Bronx Zoo!
