<p>Thank you very much for signing up to be a WCS Run for the Wild volunteer at the Bronx Zoo on April 30, 2016.  Without your help, our event could not be a success.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>*Please note: volunteers are expected to arrive by 6 AM. Most assignments are completed between 11 - 12 PM. You are welcome to stay and enjoy the zoo for the day. Light snacks will be available and t-shirt distribution will take place prior to participant arrival.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>All assignments are vital to ensure a smooth day for participants.  While we will do our best to place you in a position of your choice, we appreciate your flexibility in helping us where we can use you most.</p>
<p>As we get closer to the Run date - April 30th you will receive specific information pertaining to your assignment: your designated arrival gate, parking pass and a fact sheet about the event so that you are knowledgeable about the plans for the day.</p>
<p>In the event that you can no longer volunteer we ask that you notify us as soon as possible so that we can adjust assignments as necessary.  If you need to get more information or need to get in touch with us, please contact Rachel Libretti at <a href="mailto:rlibretti@wcs.org">rlibretti@wcs.org</a> or 718-220-7297.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for your support and for helping us to save gorillas.  We look forward to seeing you in April.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>WCS Run for the Wild Volunteer Committee</p>
