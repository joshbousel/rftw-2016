<p>Hi &ndash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m running in the WCS Run for the Wild at the Bronx Zoo on April 29 and am hoping you&rsquo;ll support me!</p>
<p>This year I&rsquo;m running for, and the money I raise will help fund WCS&rsquo;s critical work around the world to save wildlife.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m running is simple: wildlife across the world are in danger, and they can't protect themselves. It's up to individuals who care about these defenseless creatures to take a stand. And that's exactly what I plan to do when I line up at the start line on April 29 alongside thousands of others.</p>

<p>If, like me, you believe in world where all wildlife deserves to thrive, then WCS is the right organization to support. Using science to understand our natural world and protect its most vulnerable species, they&rsquo;ve identified 15 priority regions around the world that are critical to conserve &ndash; and these areas contain more than 50% (!!) of the world&rsquo;s biodiversity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so grateful for anything you can contribute and so is threatened wildlife around the globe. I&rsquo;ll make you proud on the day of the run!</p>
