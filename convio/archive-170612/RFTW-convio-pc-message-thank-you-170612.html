<p>Thank you for supporting me and the WCS Run for the Wild at the Bronx Zoo. We all have a role to play in protecting wildlife and the wild places they call home.<br /><br />
I'm getting closer to reaching my fundraising goal every day! If you want to follow my progress, you can check my personal page any time to see what I've accomplished. You can also follow links from that page to learn more about the WCS Run for the Wild, and how you can get involved. <br /><br /></p>
