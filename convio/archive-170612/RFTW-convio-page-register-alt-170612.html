<p>Make tracks for tigers in 2010 with the Wildlife  Conservation Society&rsquo;s Run for the Wild on Saturday, April 24, 2010 at the  Bronx Zoo.</p>
<p>Join us for the second annual Run for the Wild.&nbsp; Families, runners, corporations, people of  all ages, are invited to run, hop, skip, crawl or slither to the Bronx Zoo for  what proves to be one the most unique runs in New York.</p>
<p>The 5K course takes participants  on a journey throughout the beautiful Bronx Zoo grounds and home to over 5,000  animals from around the world.&nbsp; This  year, the Run for the Wild is dedicated to tigers.&nbsp; Fundraising efforts will support WCS&rsquo;s long  standing conservation goals to create protected areas where tigers can thrive  by working with local governments and reducing threats such as illegal hunting,  hunting of tigers&rsquo; prey species, and destruction of their habitats.</p>
<p>Where else in New York can you get fit, have fun, raise money and  awareness for an endangered species and then enjoy an up close encounter with  tigers?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
This year we are featuring two dedicated start times:
</p>
<blockquote>
 
    Runners at 8:30<br />
    Family Fun Run/Walk at 9:00am
