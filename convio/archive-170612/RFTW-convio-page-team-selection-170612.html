<h3>Start a Team</h3>
<p>Start a team to make tracks for wildlife - your team can consist of your family, friends, and/or co-workers. You'll be the Team Captain in charge of creating the team name, recruiting members, and establishing a fundraising goal. <strong>You'll also set up two fundraising pages, one for yourself and one for the team.</strong></p>
<p>Begin by entering your team name and fundraising goal in the box at the bottom of this page. Then, complete your registration form. <strong>Once you have submitted your own registration, you will have the opportunity to register additional teammates.</strong></p>
<p>Next, set up a team page to start fundraising! The suggested fundraising goal is $300 per team member or $1,500 per team, and the more you raise, the more prizes you'll be eligible to receive. You can even kick-start your fundraising by making a donation to help wildlife with your registration.</p>
<p>Note: If you would like to join an existing team rather than start your own, please <a href="https://secure3.convio.net/wcs/site/TRR?pg=tfind&fr_id=1190">click here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>*Remember, fundraising prizes are awarded to individuals, not teams.</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Any issues you may find please send them directly to me and
I&rsquo;ll have them updated. </p>
