WCS RUN FOR THE WILD

Participant Waiver 

I, having attained the age of 18, have requested permission of the Wildlife Conservation Society ("WCS"), LeadDog Marketing Group ("LeadDog") and the City of New York ("City") to participate in the Run for the Wild event at the Bronx Zoo (the "Event") on April 29, 2017. 

I am aware that participating in Run for the Wild is a potentially hazardous activity and contains some inherent risks of injury, illness, death and loss of property. 

I confirm that I fully understand the nature of the activities involved and recognize, accept and assume all risks, known or unknown, associated with such activities. 

IN CONSIDERATION OF THE GRANT OF SUCH PERMISSION, THE RECEIPT OF WHICH IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED, I HEREBY FOREVER INDEMNIFY, RELEASE, DISCHARGE AND HOLD HARMLESS WCS, LEADDOG, THE CITY, AND THE RESPECTIVE TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS,  OFFICERS, OFFICIALS, MEMBERS, AGENTS, SERVANTS AND EMPLOYEES OF EACH, OF AND FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, JUDGMENTS AND LEGAL FEES WHATSOEVER WHICH I MAY HAVE, NOW HAVE OR WHICH MAY ACCRUE IN MY FAVOR IN THE FUTURE ON ACCOUNT OF ANY PERSONAL INJURY, INCLUDING DEATH, OR LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO ANY PROPERTY SUFFERED OR SUSTAINED BY ME FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING THE NEGLIGENCE OF WCS, LEADDOG OR THE CITY, AND ANY OF THE RESPECTIVE TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, OFFICIALS, MEMBERS, AGENTS, SERVANTS OR 
EMPLOYEES OF EACH, DURING OR IN CONNECTION WITH MY PARTICIPATION IN THE RUN FOR THE WILD EVENT. 

I agree not to enter or participate in Run for the Wild unless I am medically able and properly trained.  I agree to abide by any decision of any Event official relating to my ability to safely complete the Event.  I give my full permission for such first aid as deemed necessary to be provided to me on the premises prior to transport to a hospital for further treatment.  I agree to abide by all safety directives of WCS officials. 

In addition, I hereby irrevocably grant to WCS, LeadDog and the City the right to record my likeness while I am participating in the Run for the Wild event and to use my likeness in all media worldwide in perpetuity, without remuneration, for WCS's institutional, educational and promotional purposes.  I understand and agree that photographs taken by WCS photographers during the Event.  I hereby irrevocably grant Event sponsors the right to record my likeness while I am participating in the Run for the Wild event and to use my likeness in all media worldwide in perpetuity, without remuneration, for the purpose of promoting and publicizing the Event and the sponsor's support of or role in the Event.

This Assumption of Risks Agreement and Release will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to New York's choice-of-law rules.  This release shall be binding upon my heirs, next of kin, executors, administrators and assigns.  In assuming these risks and signing this release I am acting freely and entirely upon my own initiative, risk and responsibility. 

California Residents:  I expressly waive all rights under Section 1542 of the Civil Code of California, which reads as follows:  "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." 

If I have registered for a person other than myself, I attest that I have that person's permission to agree to the Run for the Wild Waiver on his/her behalf. In order to participate in Run for the Wild, I understand that I must agree to the terms and conditions of this waiver by signing the reverse side of this paper.
