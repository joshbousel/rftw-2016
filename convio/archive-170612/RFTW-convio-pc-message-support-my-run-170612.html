<p>Hi &ndash;</p>
<p>I have some unsettling news. As I write this, companies are tearing down the rainforests of Africa for lumber, precious minerals, and to plant oil palms. This deforestation is putting already endangered gorillas in grave danger. In fact, some subspecies are simply dangling from a thread, like the critically endangered Cross River gorilla with fewer than <strong>300 individuals left in the wild</strong>. 300!</p>
<p>Can you imagine a world where gorillas like this one are nothing but a memory?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, with a world without gorillas is a very real possibility &ndash; unless we do something right now.</p>
<p>I want to live in a world where gorillas are not just able to barely survive, but to thrive. That's <strong>why I'm running in the WCS Run for the Wild at the Bronx Zoo in April</strong> to help ensure a future for some of our closest cousins in the wild.</p>
<p>The run supports WCS's work to safeguard key habitats that, if protected from development and hunting, can give gorillas a fighting chance for survival. Places like Takamanda-Mone Forest, a vital landscape in Cameroon where the last of the Cross River gorillas fight to survive.</p>
<p>WCS has supported gorilla conservation throughout their range in Africa <em>for decades</em>. And what WCS does <em>works</em>. They have boots on the ground working with governments, local communities, and commercial developers to protect gorillas and the rainforests they call home. But there are more places to take their successful tactics &ndash; and they need our help to do it.</p>
<p>Please &ndash; support my Run for the Wild with a tax-deductible donation to the Wildlife Conservation Society. Even a small donation will make a big difference.</p>
<p>It's an incredible organization doing vital work for the amazing gorilla. That's why I'm running &ndash; and that's why I'd appreciate <strong>your support</strong> so much.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance &ndash; I can't wait to tell you about my run through the Bronx Zoo!</p>
