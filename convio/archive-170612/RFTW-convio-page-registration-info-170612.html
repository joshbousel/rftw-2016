<p>Run for wildlife and wild places at&nbsp;WCS&rsquo;s 2016 Run for the Wild at the Bronx Zoo. This year&rsquo;s 5K run/walk
takes place on Saturday, April 29th. We&rsquo;ll have two start times, one for runners at
8:00 a.m., and a second for our Family Fun Run/Walk at 8:45 a.m.</p>
<p>Registration
for WCS Run for the Wild at the Bronx Zoo is $45 for adults, $35 for children
(3-16) and $35 for Seniors (65+).</p>
<p><strong>All
adults and senior registrants must also raise at least $30 before the run in order
to participate on April 30! The fundraising requirement is waived for children.</strong></p>
<p><em>And<strong> </strong>don&rsquo;t
wait</em> &ndash; the Run regularly sells out early. Secure your spot and
register today!</p>
<p><strong>Can't be at the Bronx Zoo on April 29th?</strong>&nbsp;You can still run to support wildlife and wild places by becoming a virtual runner. Just commit to running or walking on your own &mdash; around town, on your treadmill, even at another 5K. When you raise $30, you&rsquo;ll receive the event t-shirt; raise more and you&rsquo;ll qualify for a host of great fundraising prizes!<br />
